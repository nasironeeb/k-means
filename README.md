# k-means

## Implementation of K-means From Scratch

### Description

This project is an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm entirely hand-coded in Python, without using machine-learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The aim is to understand the fundamental concepts of the K-means algorithm and to provide a simple tool for learning and experimentation.

### Background
The K-means algorithm is a partitioning method that divides a data set into K distinct clusters, minimizing the intra-cluster variance. This algorithm is widely used in machine learning for unsupervised clustering tasks.

### Features
Markup : 
* Customized initialization: Use a random or defined centroid initialization method.
* Number of clusters: Specify the number of clusters to be identified in your data.
* Multiple iterations: The model executes any number of iterations.
* Results display: Clustering results can be displayed graphically (2D or 3D).
